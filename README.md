=============

This project uses Wolfram Alpha to answer the age-old question:

**What is the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?**

You will need to acquire an API key from Wolfram Alpha [here](https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html).

Change the value of APIKEY on line 10 in src/main/java/Swallow.java and you're good to go!

```
mvn test
```
